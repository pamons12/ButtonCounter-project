# Button-counter

## DUE: 11 Feb 2021

## Instructions:

Create an app that has three buttons, one for incrementing a counter, one for decrementing the counter, and one for resetting the counter to 0. The counter must be displayed as a **TextView** and must retain its state when the phone is rotated between portrait and landscape modes. There should be no values, such as strings, dimensions, etc. hardcoded in the .java files. They should be maintained and accessed from the appropriate resource files.

### TODO:
1. Open Android Studio and create an Android project named Button-counter-\<yourLastName\>.
2. Edit .gitignore file and put the neccessary file names that do not belong in GitHub.
3. Initialize project as a Git repoistory.
4. Fork this project into your Github account and copy the clone link.
5. Run the git remote add command to link your project to the Github repository.
6. Perform a git pull origin master command to pull the README and sync the repos.
7. Add,Commmit, and Push your initial files.
8. Verify files were uploaded to your GitHub account.
9. Complete the project.
10. Add, Commit and Push your completed project code to GitHub.
 
 
 ### Grading:
 
 The above requirements are for a 'B'. In order to achieve an 'A', then you must implement a **WOW** factor. This is normally something that you will have to think of and research how to do it yourself. For this first assignment, styling would be considered. 
 
 ***Note:*** Any issues you have with either the GitHub steps or Java/Android questions should be asked publically on Slack. If you have a question, chances are someone else does also. If you see someone has posted a question on Slack and you know the answer, please chime in and answer.
